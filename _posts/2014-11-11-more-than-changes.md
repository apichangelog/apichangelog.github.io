# More than changes

[API Changelog](https://www.apichangelog.com/ "API Changelog") has been running for over a year now and during this time we’ve been monitoring the documentation of more than [50 APIs](https://www.apichangelog.com/browse "API Changelog APIs"). On a daily basis we manually curate the most relevant changes so that developers like you get the most interesting findings on your inbox every morning and don’t get caught out when change happens.

The growing list of monitored APIs include companies like [AngelList](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/angellist "AngelList"), [Bitly](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/bitly "Bitly"), [Box](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/box "Box"), [FresBooks](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/freshbooks "FreshBooks"), [GoCardless](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/gocardless "GoCardless"), [Nest](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/nest "Nest") and [Twilio](https://www.apichangelog.com/api/twilio "Twilio"), just to name a few. Every day, these APIs generate hundreds of changes that are processed by our comparison engine. Do you remember when Twilio [deprecated support for SSLv3](https://www.apichangelog.com/changes/a88c73cf-fa9f-47e2-b57f-46fddbf2358e) after the [POODLE attack](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A "POODLE attack")? What about when Linkedin [deprecated some company related API endpoints](https://www.apichangelog.com/changes/4b510cb5-35f7-4e83-9c96-e02ad6f5094d#first-change)? Or when [Foursquare removed Gnip](https://www.apichangelog.com/changes/bdec4105-b53c-41d1-8f26-ead7ec502989) contact information from their firehose documentation page? These are the kind of changes that you don’t want to miss.

Probably more important changes include terms of use and other legal information that might affect how your business interacts with third-party APIs. The challenge here is that changes to terms of use are often not communicated to API consumers. Uber API terms of use, for instance, recently [added three items](https://www.apichangelog.com/changes/0b1bd0a6-c35c-49a4-9326-badddd9262a9) to their “Use Restrictions” which have to do with how a consumer service uses Uber data and lets their users access it.

It’s because we know that it’s important to foster a good relationship between API providers and developers that we are facilitating **beyond monitoring changes**. We want to actively engage with the companies behind the APIs and learn how they’re managing changes themselves. Because we know how useful this information is, we’re going to translate that knowledge into regular articles that will show up [here](http://blog.apichangelog.com/ "API Changelog Blog"). You’ll be able to get insights into who is behind the APIs that you’re consuming, how they interact with developers like you and, most importantly, how are API changes approved and communicated.

So, make sure you [follow us](https://twitter.com/apichangelog "API Changelog on Twitter") so that you don’t miss out. If you have a public API we’d like to talk with you so please [get in touch](http://apiux.com/contact/ "Get in touch")!
