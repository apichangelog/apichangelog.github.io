API Changelog: What is your current API change cycle and what are the core drivers for change of you API?

Chargify: We regularly add new features to the API with every release (usually daily). We also make changes or improvements based on customer feedback. But our #1 priority is always backwards-compatibility.  We have a very firm “no breaking changes” rule.



How do you enable your API consumers to participate in the change process?

Support requests are the primary way that they ask for help.  That is our funnel for most changes.  Our support system allows us to put our engineers in direct contact with the customers to help avoid having a middleman whenever possible.

Are there any major change coming up for the remainder of 2014 or early next year you want to make your developers aware of?

No major changes.




How do you class different changes, i.e. how do you know which ones will create a bigger amount of effort for your API consumers?

Because we don’t make breaking changes, we usually look for ways to add new features that don’t change our existing paradigms or resource structures.

Do you vary the timing of change release based on scale of the change?

Not typically. We try to keep all changes small and independent so that there are never any changes that are “too big”.

We all know API change will be continuous, what is the special thing your company does to make this easier for the developers using your API?
Our entire documentation website is open-source:  https://github.com/chargify/docs.chargify.com
So all changes to both the API and general information/guidance is trackable. They can always see exactly what changed and when.  It also allows developers to submit clarifications, extra info, etc if they found part of the docs confusing.


How can developers get some swag for being great user of your API?

E-mail “candy@chargify.com” and we’ll send out a t-shirt to anyone who asks.
