[Chargify](https://www.chargify.com "Chargify") is one of the leaders of the recurring billing world. Before the subscription economy was really a thing, Chargify was working away in Boston, USA. Amoungst their investors is celebrity investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. They focus on helping subscription business to focus on core business while Chargify keeps all that activity, and your cash flow, running smoothly. 

> We help thousands of businesses manage millions of recurring customers - from startups to Fortune 100. 

We were lucky enough to have a quick catch up with Drew Blas - Director of Operations Chargify.com, to discuss how they manage APIs in the context of providing millions of dollars of billing for subscription companies on a monthly basis.

**API Changelog**: What is your current API change cycle and what are the core drivers for change of you API?

**Chargify**: We regularly add new features to the API with every release (usually daily). We also make changes or improvements based on customer feedback. But our #1 priority is always backwards-compatibility.  We have a very firm “no breaking changes” rule.


**API Changelog**: How do you enable your API consumers to participate in the change process?

**Chargify**: Support requests are the primary way that they ask for help.  That is our funnel for most changes, we agregate this together and analyse. Plus our support system allows us to put our engineers in direct contact with the customers to help avoid having a middleman whenever possible.


**API Changelog**: Are there any major change coming up for the remainder of 2014 or early next year you want to make your developers aware of?

**Chargify**: We have not major changes planned at this point in time. As outlined, we are very much an incremental change development house, focusing on small and ongoing change, rather than major releases. Being in th erecurring billing space we try to avoid major change in genenral while maintaining backward compatibility.


**API Changelog**: How do you class different changes, i.e. how do you know which ones will create a bigger amount of effort for your API consumers?

**Chargify**: Because we don’t make breaking changes, we usually look for ways to add new features that don’t change our existing paradigms or resource structures. We focus on non-breaking enhancements and to date have not needed to make any major shifts.


**API Changelog**: Do you vary the timing of change release based on scale of the change?

**Chargify**: Not typically. We try to keep all changes small and independent so that there are never any changes that are “too big”.


**API Changelog**: We all know API change will be continuous, what is the special thing your company does to make this easier for the developers using your API?

**Chargify**: Our entire documentation website is open-source:  https://github.com/chargify/docs.chargify.com
So all changes to both the API and general information/guidance is trackable. They can always see exactly what changed and when. It also allows developers to submit clarifications, extra info, etc if they found part of the docs confusing.


**API Changelog**: How can developers get some swag for being great user of your API?

**Chargify**: E-mail “candy@chargify.com” and we’ll send out a t-shirt to anyone who asks.
