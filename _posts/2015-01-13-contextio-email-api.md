[Context.io](https://www.context.io "Context.io") is one of the leaders of the recurring billing world. Before the subscription economy was really a thing, Chargify was working away in Boston, USA. Amoungst their investors is celebrity investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. They focus on helping subscription business to focus on core business while Chargify keeps all that activity, and your cash flow, running smoothly. 

> We help thousands of businesses manage millions of recurring customers - from startups to Fortune 100. 

We were lucky enough to have a quick catch up with Drew Blas - Director of Operations Context.io to discuss how they manage APIs in the context of providing millions of dollars of billing for subscription companies on a monthly basis.

**API Changelog**: What is your current API change cycle and what are the core drivers for change of you API?

**Chargify**: We regularly add new features to the API with every release (usually daily). We also make changes or improvements based on customer feedback. But our #1 priority is always backwards-compatibility.  We have a very firm “no breaking changes” rule.


**API Changelog**: How do you enable your API consumers to participate in the change process?

**Chargify**: Support requests are the primary way that they ask for help.  That is our funnel for most changes, we aggregate this together and analyse. Plus our support system allows us to put our engineers in direct contact with the customers to help avoid having a middleman whenever possible.


**API Changelog**: What is your current API change cycle and what are the core drivers for change of you API?

**Context.io**: We aggregate any breaking changes for a new version, though we try to avoid that as much as possible. If the changes are non-breaking, like adding an additional filter parameter, then we will release often. This happens fairly regularly which is why we’re so excited to be on Apichangelog.com. 

The core drivers for change at Context.IO are our customers. We won’t make an update before validating it with our clients so we welcome feedback from anyone using the API. 


**API Changelog**: How do you enable your API consumers to participate in the change process?

**Context.io**: We always enjoy chatting with developers hacking on Context.IO and learning what kinds of changes they’d like. We do constant client discovery to determine which features will create the most value for developers building on top of our API. That’s how we source nearly every change we make. We love jumping on a call or answering an email thread to better understand what our developers want.


**API Changelog**: Are there any major change coming up for the remainder of 2014 or early next year you want to make your developers aware of?

**Context.io**: We’re in the middle of a private beta for native Exchange support. We’ll be entering a public beta mid-Q4 2014 for Exchange on our Lite API. We hope many people will integrate with Exchange and give us ample feedback so we can provide the best possible Exchange support.

We should note that this change will be seamless for current developers. Nothing will break for current API integrations!


**API Changelog**: How do you class different changes, i.e. how do you know which ones will create a bigger amount of effort for your API consumers?

**Context.io**: For changes that either slightly alter the performance of the API, or changes that we want developers to take advantage of, we write up a blog post or send an email out. We want to make certain that developers are aware of all the cool new stuff they can do with the API. It’s fantastic that Apichangelog.com will help us get the news out!


**API Changelog**: Do you vary the timing of change release based on scale of the change?

**Context.io**: We delay a change if it’s something that would break current integrations. We time that release out with a new version number, so that current developers are not stuck with a broken integration. The only other reason for us to delay a change is if it makes sense to pair it with another change. Then we’ll release both related updates at once, to make sure we don’t flood our developers in a sea of noise.


**API Changelog**: How can developers get some swag for being great user of your API?

**Context.io**: Just email me at dan@context.io!


**API Changelog**: What are examples of incredible applications developers have built on your API?

**Context.io**: There are so many I’d love to mention but I’ll limit it to just a couple examples. AirHelp determines if you’re entitled for up to $800 because of delayed or cancelled flights. It’s a fantastic service and a very intelligent use of the Context.IO API. 

Another client that we’re proud to partner with is Unified Inbox. They centralize external conversations, social engagement, and internal team collaboration into a single platform across desktop and mobile devices. In short, the Future of Communication! 


**API Changelog**: What is the best way to raise questions about your API changes?

**Context.io**: They can contact us directly. We’re always available for our developers. Reach out to support@context.io, or to myself (dan@context.io) or Tony (tony@context.io), our developer evangelist, directly.
